## What is Linear Regression?
Regression is predicting a continuous or real output given some inputs.  
Linear regression is mapping the relationship between the inputs and a continuous output with a straight line.    
The mapping function is known as the hypothesis.  

### Hypothesis

![hypothesis](images/hypothesis.png) 

For linear regression, the hypoothesis function is the equation of a straight line.  

In the hypothesis above, there is only one input variable x.  
The parameters theta are a measure of how strongly the the inputs influence the output.  
Theta 0 is the bias term.  
These parameters are learned by the linear regression algorithm as it is being trained thorough gradient descent.
